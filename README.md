# INF551-Data-Management

As part of my INF 551: Data Management course, I had the opportunity to explore various technologies such as MySQL, Firebase and Flask from Python. I have written scripts that make use of or interact with these technologies to acheieve certain assignment objectives or problem statements. 

The course had five take home assignments and one final project associated with it. I have uploaded all the homework/final project descriptions and the scripts associated with them.
